**Huffman Encoding and Decoding with Python**

Welcome to Huffman Encoding and Decoding with Python! This repository contains a Python implementation of Huffman encoding and decoding algorithm. Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression, where characters are assigned variable-length codes based on their frequencies of occurrence.

### Getting Started

To use this Huffman encoding and decoding script, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate into the cloned repository directory.

3. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python script `huffman.py`.

### Usage

This script demonstrates Huffman encoding and decoding in Python.

- **Encoding**: The script generates Huffman codes for a given set of characters and their frequencies, and then encodes a message using these codes.

- **Decoding**: After encoding a message, the script allows decoding another message using the same Huffman codes. It prompts the user to enter an encoded message and decodes it using the stored Huffman codes.
